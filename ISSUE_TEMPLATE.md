This bug-tracker is monitored by developers and other technical types.  We like detail!  So please use this form and tell us, concisely but precisely, what's up.  Please fill out ALL THE FIELDS!

If you have a feature request, please post to [the UserVoice](https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/266908).  If you're reporting a BSOD, don't post here!  Instead, e-mail "secure@microsoft.com", and if possible attach the minidump from "C:\Windows\minidump\".


* Your Windows build number:  (Type `ver` at a Windows Command Prompt)

* What you're doing and what's happening:  (Copy&paste specific commands and their output, or include screen shots)

* What's wrong / what should be happening instead:

* Strace of the failing command, if applicable:  (If `<cmd>` is failing, then run `strace -o strace.txt -ff <cmd>`, and post the strace.txt output here)
