**Important: When reporting BSODs or security issues, DO NOT attach memory dumps, logs, or traces to Github issues**.
Instead, send dumps/traces to secure@microsoft.com, referencing this GitHub issue. Ideally, please [configure your machine to capture minidumps](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/315263/how-to-read-the-small-memory-dump-file-that-is-created-by-windows-if-a), repro the issue, and send the minidump from "C:\Windows\minidump\".

Please use the following bug reporting template to help produce issues which are actionable and reproducible, including **all** command-line steps necessary to induce the failure condition. See [our contributing instructions](https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information. If this is a console issue (a problem with layout, rendering, colors, etc.), please post to the [terminal tracker](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues). For documentation improvements, please post to the [documentation tracker](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WSL/issues).
